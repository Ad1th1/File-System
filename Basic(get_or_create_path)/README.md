Just wanted to start out exploring file systems because one of my juniors made one, lol!

Just checked out a super basic get-or-create path, kind of file system in python.

This is the site I checked out to create it: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design-file-system-in-python#:~:text=Practical%20Data%20Science%20using%20Python&text=createPath(path%2C%20value)%20%E2%88%92,the%20path%20doesn't%20exist.

Cheers to exploring and understanding more complex file systems soon...
